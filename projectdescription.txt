Project Title: "Generating Realistic Images using GANs"

Problem Description: The aim of this project is to develop a GAN model that can generate realistic images of a specific type of object or scene, such as faces, landscapes, or animals. The challenge is to train the GAN model to learn the underlying patterns and features of the training data, and generate new images that are visually similar to the real ones.

Data Description: The dataset we will use is the "CelebA" dataset, which contains over 200,000 celebrity face images with annotations such as facial landmarks, hair color, and gender. The dataset can be downloaded from the official website () or from other sources such as Kaggle.

Analysis Steps:

Load and preprocess the data: Load the CelebA dataset and perform any necessary preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.

Define the GAN architecture: Define the generator and discriminator networks using a deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Experiment with different network architectures and hyperparameters to find the optimal model.

Train the GAN model: Train the GAN model on the preprocessed CelebA dataset using the defined architecture. Monitor the training process and adjust the hyperparameters if necessary.

Evaluate the GAN model: Evaluate the performance of the trained GAN model by generating new images and comparing them with real images from the CelebA dataset. Use metrics such as Inception Score or Frechet Inception Distance to measure the quality and diversity of the generated images.

Fine-tune the GAN model: Fine-tune the GAN model by incorporating techniques such as progressive growing, conditional GANs, or style transfer to improve the quality and realism of the generated images.
